# Localhost Development Configuration
# Copy this content to your .env file when developing locally

# Change this line for localhost development:
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000

# Or if using php artisan serve:
# APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

# For production, change back to:
# APP_URL=https://admin.johnjess.com

# Note: The asset helper will automatically detect localhost and use 
# the current origin, but having the correct APP_URL helps with 
# other Laravel features like URL generation in emails, etc.
