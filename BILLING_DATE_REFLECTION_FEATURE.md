# Automatic Date Calculation Features

## Overview
This system implements comprehensive automatic date and status calculations for daily trips:
1. **Billing Date Reflection**: Automatically sets the "Date of Billing" to match the "Issuance Date of S.I" (Sales Invoice)
2. **Due Date Calculation**: Automatically calculates the "Due Date" as 60 days after the "Date of Billing"
3. **Automatic Remarks**: Real-time calculation of payment status based on due date vs current date
   - **Overdue** ‚ö†Ô∏è: Due date has passed
   - **Due Today** ‚è∞: Due date is today
   - **Upcoming** ‚úÖ: Due date is in the future

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes (DailyTripModal.tsx)
- **Automatic Reflection Logic**: 
  - When the user selects an issuance date for the S.I, the billing date is automatically set to the same value
  - When the billing date changes, the due date is automatically calculated as 60 days later
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Added blue link icons (üîó) for billing date field relationship
  - Added purple calendar icons (üìÖ) for due date field
  - Added helpful text explaining the automatic behavior
  - Styled auto-calculated fields with colored backgrounds (blue for billing, purple for due date)
- **Helper Functions**:
  - `calculateDueDate()`: Calculates due date by adding 60 days to billing date
  - `calculateRemarks()`: Determines status based on due date vs current date
  - `getRemarksColor()` / `getRemarksStyle()`: Provides appropriate styling for each status
  - Enhanced date formatting and validation
- **Real-time Status Display**: Remarks are calculated dynamically and displayed with appropriate colors and icons
- **User Override**: Users can still manually adjust billing date, due date, and remarks when needed

### Backend Changes 
**DailyTripController.php:**
- **Server-side Validation**: Added automatic date calculations on both creation and update operations
- **Billing Date Logic**: If no billing date is provided but an issuance date exists, the system automatically copies the issuance date to the billing date
- **Due Date Logic**: If no due date is provided but a billing date exists, the system automatically calculates the due date as 60 days after the billing date
- **Date Calculation**: Uses PHP DateTime with DateInterval('P60D') for accurate 60-day calculations
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures consistency between frontend and backend behavior for all date calculations

**DailyTrip.php Model:**
- **Computed Attribute**: Added `auto_remarks` computed attribute that calculates status in real-time
- **Carbon Integration**: Uses Carbon for accurate date comparisons and calculations
- **API Response**: Auto-remarks are automatically included in API responses via `$appends`
- **Consistent Logic**: Server-side calculation matches frontend logic exactly

### Model Changes (DailyTrip.php)
- **HasFactory Trait**: Added the HasFactory trait to enable testing with model factories

### New Features in Display
- **Enhanced View Modal**: Added an "Important Dates" section showing:
  - Issuance Date of S.I
  - Date of Billing (auto-reflected)
  - Due Date

## User Experience

### Creating a New Trip
1. User fills in trip details
2. When user selects "Issuance Date of S.I":
   - The "Date of Billing" is automatically filled with the same date
   - The "Due Date" is automatically calculated as 60 days after the billing date
3. If user manually changes "Date of Billing", the "Due Date" automatically recalculates
4. User can override both billing and due dates if needed
5. Visual cues (blue styling for billing, purple styling for due date) indicate automatic behavior

### Editing an Existing Trip
1. User opens an existing trip for editing
2. If user changes the "Issuance Date of S.I":
   - The "Date of Billing" automatically updates
   - The "Due Date" automatically recalculates based on the new billing date
3. If user changes only the "Date of Billing", the "Due Date" automatically recalculates
4. Manual date adjustments are preserved when explicitly set

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite created (`DailyTripBillingDateTest.php`) covering:

**Date Calculation Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic billing date reflection on creation
- ‚úÖ Automatic billing date reflection on update  
- ‚úÖ Manual billing date preservation when explicitly provided
- ‚úÖ Proper handling when no issuance date is provided
- ‚úÖ Automatic due date calculation from billing date on creation
- ‚úÖ Automatic due date calculation through issuance ‚Üí billing ‚Üí due date chain
- ‚úÖ Automatic due date calculation on update
- ‚úÖ Manual due date preservation when explicitly provided
- ‚úÖ Due date calculation across year boundaries (edge case testing)

**Remarks Calculation Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic remarks calculation for "Overdue" status (past due date)
- ‚úÖ Automatic remarks calculation for "Due Today" status (current date)
- ‚úÖ Automatic remarks calculation for "Upcoming" status (future date)
- ‚úÖ Proper handling when no due date is set
- ‚úÖ Backend computed attribute testing
- ‚úÖ API response includes auto_remarks field

**Total: 13 test cases, 52 assertions - All passing ‚úÖ**

## Benefits
1. **Reduced Data Entry**: Users don't need to manually calculate and enter dates
2. **Consistency**: Ensures proper date relationships (issuance ‚Üí billing ‚Üí due date)
3. **Automated Due Date Management**: Automatically calculates payment due dates (60 days after billing)
4. **Flexibility**: Still allows manual override when business logic requires different dates
5. **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded fields and icons show the relationship between date fields
6. **Data Integrity**: Backend validation ensures consistency even if frontend logic is bypassed
7. **Business Logic Compliance**: Enforces standard 60-day payment terms automatically
8. **Error Prevention**: Reduces manual calculation errors for due dates

## Complete Automation Flow
```
Issuance Date of S.I (Manual Entry)
           ‚Üì (Auto-reflects)
    Date of Billing (Same as issuance date)
           ‚Üì (Auto-calculates +60 days)
       Due Date (60 days after billing date)
           ‚Üì (Real-time comparison with current date)
    Remarks Status (Overdue/Due Today/Upcoming)
```

### Examples:
- **Issuance Date**: 2025-10-15
- **Billing Date**: 2025-10-15 (auto-filled)
- **Due Date**: 2025-12-14 (auto-calculated: billing date + 60 days)
- **Remarks**: 
  - If today is 2025-12-15: "Overdue" ‚ö†Ô∏è (red)
  - If today is 2025-12-14: "Due Today" ‚è∞ (amber)
  - If today is 2025-11-01: "Upcoming" ‚úÖ (green)
